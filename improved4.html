On the building test they missed one parameter to evaluate: irregular floor. They started with a flat horizontal floor. What if the Mars location has a slope, of some irregularities like big rocks ? Will the AI adjust to those parameters ? and also the A.I really needs to be improve by really trying to incorporate actual happenings on the planet mars, from the gravity to temperature , from most simple to complex one, thus this technology will really survived?

Also it is more likely building structure below instead above, With the hard climate on Mars, it seems that building an underground base of operations would be much better protected and easier than waiting for crops to grow and then harvesting materials for your build. What happens when your concrete slurry mixture freezes or sets before the next layer is added? The entire structure would seem to be made up of independent layers instead of a solid/bonded structure. These are just my questions, and obviously I know nothing about Mars, but just figured itâ€™s worth exploring.

When it comes to A.I technology in farming I think the things needed to improved is that Fine-tuning AI algorithms and models is really important in farming. Farming can change a lot because of things like weather, soil conditions, and pests, which keep shifting. To keep up with these changes, AI systems have to keep getting better at predicting what will happen. This means we need to keep working on and improving the computer programs that run these AI systems. We also need to make sure they can use real-time data to make smarter decisions.

Another crucial thing is making sure that AI tools are easy to use and not too expensive for all farmers. Some farms are small and might not have fancy technology, so they might struggle with the cost or finding someone who knows how to use it. To help these farmers, we should create AI tools that are simple to use and don't cost a lot. This way, more farmers can benefit from AI technology in farming.</br><br></br>
