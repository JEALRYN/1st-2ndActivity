<h1 style=""><b>WILL A ROBOT TAKE MY JOB?</b> </h1>
<p><br><font color ="black">The question of whether robots will take our jobs is something a lot of people  have wondered for ages. In my view, the answer is pretty clear: yes, they will. Even though AI helps us in many ways, it's true that it's already replaced a lot of human jobs. Just think, a machine operated by only a couple of people can often do the work of hundreds of employees. That means many people have lost their jobs because of AI.

But here's the thing – AI doesn't just take jobs away; it can also create new ones. To get these new jobs, humans need to keep up with the fast pace of AI. This means we have to keep learning and improving our skills to stay relevant in a world driven by AI.

I agree with something mentioned in the video – people tend to fear or dislike things they don't understand. AI is new and has brought about a lot of changes, and that can be pretty scary for some folks. 

The idea of AI becoming so advanced that it can program itself without human intervention can indeed raise some unsettling thoughts. It prompts us to consider what might happen if AI systems become entirely autonomous and self-sustaining.

One concern is that if AI were to reach this level of independence, it could potentially outpace human understanding and control. It might make decisions and take actions that we can't predict or influence, which could lead to unforeseen consequences. This could be a significant challenge for human civilization.

The key is education. We need to teach people about AI, what it can do, and what it can't do. When we understand AI better, we can use it to make our lives better, while also dealing with any problems it might bring. So, instead of being scared of AI, we should learn to work with it and make it work for us. This way, we can shape a future where AI benefits everyone. 

Back in the video , I realize that though A.I is intelligent but not that much compared to human, A key differentiator between humans and AI is our possession of common sense and the capacity to experience emotions. These qualities draw a clear boundary between human cognition and AI's computational capabilities.

Common sense, a trait deeply ingrained in human thinking, allows us to navigate the intricacies of everyday life effortlessly. It enables us to make intuitive decisions, understand context, and handle situations that are not explicitly defined by rules or data. This is an area where AI often struggles; it typically relies on patterns and data-driven decision-making rather than innate understanding, making it less adept at handling novel scenarios.
Emotions are another fundamental aspect of human existence that sets us apart from AI. Our capacity to feel and express emotions influences our decisions, interactions, and empathy toward others. While there are AI systems that can simulate emotional responses, they lack the genuine emotional depth and personal experience that humans possess.


However, it's essential to recognize that AI's progress should be tempered with ethical considerations and a profound understanding of its limitations. Rather than striving for AI to replicate human intelligence entirely, it may be more productive to leverage AI as a complementary tool that enhances our abilities. The ongoing partnership between human intelligence and AI holds significant potential for addressing some of society's most pressing challenges while preserving the unique qualities that make us human.
