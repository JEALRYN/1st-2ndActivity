On the first A.I technology featured in the video , I think Emotions seem hard to recreate, but if we think about it hard enough, our brain is kinda like code, we choose what to do depending on what is happening, what we know, how we were thought to do it. So it is kinda like a complicated version of AI learning. The only difference is humans have different ways to go about life. So the most obvious flaw is that multiple robots act the same, but how about if there was several personalities robots can have or a trait randomizer, there would be  almost no difference. Also not until the engineers figure out how a robot can experience pain or pleasure, they haven't crossed the line to being alive. </br><br>

On the second A.I technology featured on the video, the movie director said, "Literally all interpretation is projection." everything, even BENJAMIN is based on input. we are too, from conception to death our brains, our minds, our consciousness is based on what input has entered our brains through our senses and experiences. the actual framework of humanity is the physics of the brain and our bodies. all the chemicals, structures, proteins, atoms, particles, everything inside the 'skin bag' is what a human being is. perhaps this director and digital artist and BENJAMIN need a neurologist/neuroscientist to help them design a better model of communications analysis. Also ,while AI can generate text, it often lacks the ability to capture the depth of human emotion and subtle nuances required for compelling storytelling. Improving sentiment analysis and emotional intelligence within AI systems could make the generated scripts more emotionally resonant.</br><br>

On the last A.I technology featured in the video , I don't have anything to add up but I see in the comment section that "They should have interviewed Elon Musk about Space X and Tesla because his visions and ideas are way ahead of everyone. Tesla's autonomy hardware is years ahead of any autonomy hardware that exists as Elon said he couldn't find any and had to make it themselves. All the Tesla Cars currently out there are hardware ready and they are waiting for Software approval for Full-Autonomy. They are even preparing another generation chip for the future ahead. The only industry close to commercial useable full autonomy is Tesla".</br>
